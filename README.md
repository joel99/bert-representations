# bert-representations
A Unified View of BERT Representations in Fine-Tuning, Transfer, and Forgetting

Course project for Deep Learning for Text. We ask: How do BERT representations match model behavior?

Work by Joel Ye, Sri Vivek Vanga, Ayush Shrivastava.

Writeup (with citations) in `bert-representations.pdf`.

A normal project might have main scripts, trainers, and model files. HuggingFace graciously takes care of all of this infrastructure. Our codebase largely builds on top of this, consisting of scripts that run the exact experiments, and extract + analyze representations.
